Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1)

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, a static webpage code for the project was provided. It was not usable on mobile devices. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My goal was to turn this into a responsive and accessible web page. I also needed to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

 

### How to Run the Application


First clone this project:

$ git clone https://github.com/stearruda/restaurant-reviews-app-stage-1.git

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
